Each of the ET interferometers will be operated by a low-noise laser (called the high power laser (HPL) in the following). As no current laser design can meet the ET stability requirements several nested stabilization control loops are required to the reduce the fluctuations of the free-running laser before the light can be injected into the main interferometer. Like in all currently operating GWDs a first ET laser stabilization layer will be installed on a seismically isolated laser table outside the vacuum system. The combined system of HPL and first stabilization laser is called the prestabilized laser (PSL) and is discussed in this section. The first subsection will describe the low-noise laser concepts for the ET-LF and ET-HF HPL and the different actuators that the HPLs will provide for power and frequency stabilization. The second subsection will discuss passive and active noise reduction concepts that prepare the light for injection into the suspended modecleaner described in the auxilliary optics subsection %\ref{sec:{Auxilliary Optics}}

{\bf High power laser}

The ET-HF HPL has to operate in a single-frequency continous-wave (cw) mode at a wavelength of 1064\,nm and needs to deliver 500\,W in a linear polarized fundamental $\rm HG_{00}$ mode. The higher order mode content of this laser should be below 10\% and the polarization purity at least 1/10. It is likely that the 500\,W laser power will be generated by a coherent combination of several high-power laser-amplifier stages seeded by one or two low-power low-noise master laser(s). Two different concepts are currently under investigation for such master-oscillator power-amplifier (MOPA) stages at the 250\,W output power level. One concept is based on mode-selectively pumped Nd:Vandat amplifiers which do not suffer from depolarizaton problems as Nd:YAG systems would do. A power of roughly 200\,W was lately generated with a commercial neoVAN-4S-HP amplifier chain with low noise and high spatial purity \cite{Bode2020}. Investigations are underway to increase the output power of such a solid state amplifier chain to 250-300\,W. As solid-state MOPA chains are more complex compared to fiber based MOPAs, they serve as fall back solutions for ET-HF HPLs and will not be further discussed in this document.

Fiber amplifiers offer a highly-efficient and compact way to amplify laser light to the kW level. The amplification of narrow linewidth single mode seed lasers is, however, limited by nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). Large mode-area (LMA) fibers in combination with losses for high-order spatial modes introduced by bending of the fiber can lead to high SBS free output powers in a single spatial mode operation. The SBS threshold can be further increased by a differential temperature induced shift of the SBS gain spectrum along the fiber and via a counter-propagating pumping scheme. A 300\,W fiber amplifier system that meets the high spatial purity and low noise requirements was demonstrated by Theeg et al \cite{Theeg} and a ...(reference to Nice development). Higher power levels generated with fiber based MOPAs were reported in literature but only limited information on spatial purity and noise performance of such systems is available. Especially the relative power noise (RPN) at radio frequencies is not shown which is prone to increase at pump power levels well below the onset of significant SBS related power in the back-ward propagation direction \cite{LZH}. Hence a conservative approach is taken for ET-HF that assumes that two fiber based MOPA systems with 250-300\,W will be coherently combined to form the ET-HF HPL. 
The fiber amplifier modules of such 250-300\,W systems will incorporate a mode-field adapter, a pump-light stripper, an active fiber and a pump-light combiner that couples the light of the fiber based pump diodes into the active LMA fiber. The amplified light will leave the fiber via a fused silica end cap to reduce the light intensity at the glas air interface and with this the risk of contamination induced damage.

Different options are under investigation for the seed laser design. A fiber-oscillator in combination with a fiber-preamplifier allows for an monolithic all fiber design that includes fiber based components such as Faraday isolators (FIs), electro-optical modulators (EOMs) and acousto-optical modulators (AOMs). All these components including the high power LMA amplifier are spliced together and form a monolithic HPL module. A second concepts relies on the non-planar ring-oscillator (NPRO) seed as used in all currently operating GWDs. Free space EOMs, AOMs and FIs can be used to condition the laser light before it is coupled into either a solid-state or a fiber pre-amplifier. This amplifer is either spliced or free space coupled to the mode-field adapter of the LMA high power amplifier. A trade-off study between these two concepts will lead to the final ET-HF seed laser concept. Both seed laser concepts can provide  actuators with enough range and speed for the PSL frequency stabilization. As the power noise of a MOPA system is usually dominated by the high power amplifier and as the modulation of the pump diodes of this stage offer a large actuation range without cross coupling to the laser frequency, the pump current of the LMA amplifier's pump diodes will serve as the PSL power actuator.
\\
The coherent combination will be performed on a beam combiner (beam splitter) before the pre-modecleaner cavity (PMC, see next subsection) . Both of the to-be combined beams are separately aligned to the Eigenmode of the PMC which guarantees an optimal spatial overlap. The differential phase between the beams will be sensed at the second beam combiner port. A phase-lock control loop will feed back to either one of the seed lasers (in case different seed lasers are used) or to a piezo-controlled mirror or a fiber strecher in one amplifer's beam path (in case of a single seed laser). Long term test will reveal if alignment control loops are required to keep a good interference contrast at the beam combiner.

The ET-LP laser has to operate in a single-frequency continous-wave (cw) mode at a wavelength of 1550\,nm and needs to deliver 5\,W in a linear polarized fundamental $\rm HG_{00}$ mode. The laser should have a high spatial purity. Several commercial seed laser and Erbium based fiber amplifiers are available. The seed laser are either based on fiber oscillators or external-cavity laser diodes to generate low noise beams with several 10\,mW power. Several MOPA configurations with Er fiber amplifiers were tested at the 2\,W level and show spatial purity and noise levels consistent with ET-LF requirements \cite{meylahn}. The amplification to the required power level of 5\,W by an other Er fiber amplifier is straight forward. (Low noise fiber amplifiers with output power of more than 100\,W have been demonstrated \cite{deVarona}). In the case of a laser diode based seed laser the pump current can be uses as a fast frequency actuator with 50\,kHz actuation bandwidth. The power noise can be reduced by feed-back to either the fiber amplifier's pump diodes or via an external electro-optical amplitude modulator (EOAM).

{\bf Prestabilization}

Even though laser systems with very low free running power and frequency noise are chosen for ET sophisticated nested stabilization schemes are required to achieve stability levels in the interferometers that do not limit the GW sensitivity. A first stabilization layer, the so called prestabilization is performed on the laser table outside the vacuum system. The goal of the prestabilization system is to reduce the laser fluctuations well below the level of noise added by the Doppler and beam pointing effects due to motion of the laser table with respect to the seismically isolated interferometer frame.  
Power in higher order spatial modes as well as beam pointing fluctuations are reduced by passive spatial filtering with stable optical ring resonators called modecleaner (PMC in case of the filtering on the laser table). 
In the case of ET-LF a fiber could be used as a spatial mode filter and as a tranfer fiber to deliver the laser light via a seismically isolated output coupler in the interferometer reference frame. This could strongly reduce the noise introduced between the laser table and the suspended modecleaners. Further investigations will reveal if non-linear effects or added phase noise in such a fiber would prevail the benefits.
In the case of ET-HF the power levels are to high for a fiber based modecleaner such that a PMC needs to be part of the PSL. A PMC has the additional benefit, that it filters power noise at rf frequencies and that it can provide spatially stable pick-off ports for the frequency and power stabilization and potentially for phase look loops of the squeezing or length and alignment control subsystem.
\\
The PSL frequency stabilization will use a rigid spacer high Finesse reference cavity which is seismically isolated inside a vacuum system. A feedback control loop with a high unity gain frequency of several hundred kHz is required to allow for high bandwidth second layer control loops. These will use the suspended modecleaner and the main interferometer as frequency references and will feed back either via a summation point into the error point of the PSL loop or to an AOM frequency shifter placed between the main laser and the rigid reference cavity.
\\
A high unity gain frequency is as well required for the PSL power stabilization control loop. This needs to reduce the relative power noise (RPN) of the beam leaving the PMC to roughly $10^{-8} / \sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$  As the speed of the feedback to the diode laser pump source of the HPL is limited to several 10\,kHz a fast EOAM will be part of this control loop. The power noise sensor for the power stabilization loop will be a high-power photodiode placed into one of the pick-off ports of the PMC. Due to pointing-to-RPN or polarization-to-RPN coupling by the suspended modecleaner a sensor for the second layer power stabilization has to be places after the modecleaner close to the power recycling mirror. The second layer loop power stabilization loop will either feed back into the error point of the first loop or to an in-vacuum EOAM.

The general PSL layout will be very similar for the ET-HF and ET-LF PSLs. Due to the two orders of magnitude lower power level the stabilization of the ET-LF laser might be easier as more integrated fiber components can be used. These have typically higher bandwidth and are less alignment sensitive. This small advantage might, however, be compensated by the fact that the ET-LF requires stability at much lower Fourier frequencies. This is generally harder as scattered light and beam pointing coupling to the control loop's sensors is larger at low frequencies. 

Prototypes for both the ET-HF and ET-LF PSLs will be set up in research labs in the near future to test the Et laser designs, the stabilization concepts and to gain insight into the longterm drift behavior of such systems.
