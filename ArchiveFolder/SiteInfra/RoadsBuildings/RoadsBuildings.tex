I would add:
3.3.3
Sensing in underground environment
(passive chains have undergo to internal mode excitation that is much lesser impacting on the detector. The sensor noise will be the limit. In case of KAGRA, the system relies more on the mechanics and the low seism, but probably new class of sensors should be developed. This problem was already clear ten years ago, but a very small progress has been done so far). The problem is equivalently and maybe more present in active seismic attenuator ).

3.3.4
clean Boots and large mass payload assembly and installation tools

3.3.5
Assembling laboratories (clean rooms auxiliary vacuum chambers on site.....)}
